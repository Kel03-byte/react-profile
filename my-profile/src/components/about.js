                    Hi I am a current UWA Coding Bootcamp student and amd enjoying
                    the tough challenges that I have been doing so far. I am also a
                    full time worker at the Airport for a car rental company. I have
                    always been interested in tech and gaming and finally have the
                    opportunity to learn more about the process behind some of my favourite
                    games and tech. The links below are to
                    some of my work at UWA.
